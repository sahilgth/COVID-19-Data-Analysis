🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & 🌍 World Happiness Correlation

📌 Overview

This project analyzes the global spread and impact of COVID-19 and examines how it may correlate with the World Happiness Index. Using Python libraries—Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn—we clean, process, and visualize data to uncover trends and insights.

📊 Tools & Libraries Used
Pandas – Data manipulation and merging

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

🔗 Datasets Used
COVID-19 Cases and Deaths – Daily/total confirmed data by country

World Happiness Report – Scores based on GDP, social support, life expectancy, freedom, and more

🔍 Objectives
Merge COVID-19 and World Happiness datasets by country

Visualize infection and mortality trends globally

Analyze correlation between happiness factors and COVID-19 impact

Identify any surprising patterns or anomalies

📈 Key Insights
Heatmaps and scatter plots reveal how higher happiness scores may relate to lower COVID-19 death rates in some regions

Countries with higher GDP and social support tend to show different pandemic outcomes

Visualization of outliers and patterns provides a better understanding of socio-economic resilience during crises
